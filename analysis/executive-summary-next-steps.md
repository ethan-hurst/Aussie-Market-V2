   - Complete UI for QR/PIN redemption
   - Essential for order fulfillment

2. **Shipment Label/Tracking Interface** (5-6 days)  
   - Label generation and tracking display
   - Critical for delivery management

3. **Complete KYC Verification Flow** (4-5 days)
   - Full identity verification process
   - Required for seller onboarding

4. **Admin User Management Interface** (3-4 days)
   - Essential platform management tools
   - Critical for operations

#### **Week 3-4: User Experience Enhancement**
Focus on High Priority items that significantly improve user experience:

2. **Dispute Filing Interface** (4-5 days)
3. **Enhanced Search/Filtering** (3-4 days)
4. **Watchlist/Favorites System** (3-4 days)

### 🏗️ **Implementation Approach**

#### **Parallel Development Strategy**
```
Track 1: Frontend UI Components (2 developers)
Track 2: API Endpoints & Integration (2 developers)  
Track 3: Testing & Quality Assurance (1 QA specialist)
Track 4: Database Optimization (1 backend developer)
```

#### **Risk Mitigation**
- **Daily standups** to track progress against critical timeline
- **Feature flags** to allow gradual rollout of new functionality
- **Comprehensive testing** parallel to development (not sequential)
- **Rollback plans** for each major feature deployment

## Resource Requirements

### 👥 **Team Composition (Recommended)**
- **2 Frontend Developers** - UI component development
- **2 Backend Developers** - API endpoints, integrations  
- **1 QA Testing Specialist** - Comprehensive testing strategy
- **1 DevOps Engineer** - Deployment, monitoring, infrastructure
- **1 Product Manager** - Coordination, user acceptance testing

### ⏱️ **Timeline Breakdown**
```
Days 1-7:   Critical Blocking Issues (Tier 1 - Part 1)
Days 8-14:  Critical Blocking Issues (Tier 1 - Part 2)
Days 15-21: High Priority Features (Tier 2 - Part 1)  
Days 22-28: High Priority Features (Tier 2 - Part 2)
Days 29+:   Medium Priority Enhancements (Tier 3)
```

### 💰 **Estimated Development Effort**
- **Tier 1 Critical:** ~140 developer hours (3.5 weeks @ 40hrs/week)
- **Tier 2 High Priority:** ~180 developer hours (4.5 weeks)
- **Tier 3 Medium Priority:** ~120 developer hours (3 weeks)
- **Total for Production Ready:** ~320 hours (2 months with team)

## Quality Assurance Strategy

### 🧪 **Testing Framework Enhancement**
Current testing infrastructure is good but needs expansion:

**Immediate Testing Needs:**
- API contract testing for new endpoints
- Cross-browser testing for new UI components  
- Performance testing for real-time features
- Security testing for payment/admin features
- Accessibility testing for all new interfaces

**Testing Parallel to Development:**
- Unit tests written alongside component development
- Integration tests for each new API endpoint
- E2E tests for complete user journeys
- Performance benchmarking for scalability

### 📊 **Quality Gates**
- **95% test coverage** for critical payment/admin paths
- **85% overall coverage** for all new functionality
- **Performance benchmarks** must be maintained
- **Security penetration testing** before production
- **Accessibility compliance** (WCAG 2.1 AA) validation
