## Test Execution Strategy

### Phase 1: Core Business Validation
```bash
# Run critical business functionality tests
npx playwright test seller-listing-creation-mvp.spec.ts
npx playwright test buyer-discovery-bidding-mvp.spec.ts  
npx playwright test realtime-auction-features-mvp.spec.ts
```

### Phase 2: Production Readiness
```bash
# Performance and compatibility testing
npx playwright test production-performance-mvp.spec.ts
npx playwright test mobile-crossbrowser-mvp.spec.ts
```

### Phase 3: Integration Testing
```bash
# End-to-end system validation
npx playwright test integration-suite-mvp.spec.ts
```

### Phase 4: Automated MVP Validation
```bash
# Run complete MVP test suite
./scripts/run-mvp-tests.sh
```

## Browser & Device Coverage

### Desktop Testing
- **Chrome** (Primary): Full test suite
- **Firefox**: Core functionality + compatibility
- **Safari**: Core functionality + compatibility

### Mobile Testing  
- **Chrome Mobile** (Android): Touch interactions, responsive design
- **Safari Mobile** (iOS): iOS-specific behaviors, gestures

### Performance Testing
- **Load Testing**: 10+ concurrent users
- **Memory Testing**: Memory leak detection
- **Network Testing**: Various connection speeds

## Success Criteria

### MVP Deployment Readiness

âœ… **CRITICAL Requirements (100% pass rate required):**
- Complete seller listing creation workflow
- Complete buyer bidding workflow  
- Real-time auction functionality
- Payment processing integration
- Order lifecycle state management

âœ… **HIGH Priority (90% pass rate required):**
- Page load times < 3 seconds
- Mobile responsive design
- Cross-browser functionality
- Error handling and recovery

âœ… **MEDIUM Priority (80% pass rate required):**
- Performance under concurrent load
- Security validation
- WebSocket connection resilience

## Test Data Strategy

### Mock Data Approach
All tests use comprehensive mocking to ensure:
- **Consistency**: Predictable test scenarios
- **Isolation**: No external dependencies  
- **Speed**: Fast execution without real API calls
- **Coverage**: Test error conditions and edge cases

### Test Scenarios Covered
- **Happy Path**: Successful user workflows
- **Error Conditions**: API failures, network issues, validation errors
- **Edge Cases**: Concurrent bidding, race conditions, timeouts
- **Performance**: High load, memory constraints, slow networks

## Continuous Integration Integration

### GitHub Actions Integration
```yaml
- name: Run MVP Test Suite
  run: |
    npm install
    npx playwright install
    ./scripts/run-mvp-tests.sh
```

### Test Reporting
- **HTML Reports**: Visual test results with screenshots
- **JSON Reports**: Machine-readable results for CI/CD
- **Custom MVP Report**: Business-focused readiness assessment

## Common Issues & Troubleshooting

### Test Environment Setup
```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install
npx playwright install

# Verify setup
npx playwright test --list

# Run smoke tests
npx playwright test smoke.spec.ts
```

### Performance Test Optimization
- Use single worker for consistency
- Disable parallel execution for load tests
- Increase timeouts for performance tests
- Monitor memory usage during test runs

### Mobile Testing Setup
```bash
# Enable mobile testing
export MOBILE_TEST=true

# Run mobile-specific tests
npx playwright test --project=mobile-chrome
npx playwright test --project=mobile-safari
```

## MVP Readiness Checklist
