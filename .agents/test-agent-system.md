# ðŸ§ª Multi-Agent System Test

This file is used to test that the multi-agent system is working correctly.

## Test Instructions

### 1. Test Central AI Coordinator
Load the main `AGENTS.md` file in Cursor. You should see:
- Role identity as "Central AI Coordinator"
- Access to all MCP Archon tools
- Focus on task creation and agent coordination

### 2. Test Backend Engineer
Load `.agents/backend-engineer.md` in a new Cursor instance. You should see:
- Role identity as "Backend Engineer"
- Focus on server-side development and infrastructure
- Current priority: P1 staging canary E2E gate setup

### 3. Test Agent Communication
1. Central AI creates a test Archon task
2. Central AI assigns task to Backend Engineer
3. Backend Engineer updates task status to "doing"
4. Backend Engineer completes work and moves to "review"
5. Central AI validates and marks "done"

## Validation Checklist

### System Setup âœ…
- [x] Main `AGENTS.md` file created
- [x] All agent configuration files created in `.agents/` directory
- [x] Agent communication protocols documented
- [x] Workflow documentation complete

### Agent Configurations âœ…
- [x] Central AI Coordinator (`central-ai.md`)
- [x] Backend Engineer (`backend-engineer.md`) 
- [x] Frontend Specialist (`frontend-specialist.md`)
- [x] Supabase Specialist (`supabase-specialist.md`)
- [x] Security Auditor (`security-auditor.md`)
- [x] Quality Engineer (`quality-engineer.md`)
- [x] Session Librarian (`session-librarian.md`)

### Documentation âœ…
- [x] System overview and architecture
- [x] Agent role definitions and responsibilities
- [x] Communication protocols and workflows
- [x] Activation instructions and examples
- [x] Best practices and troubleshooting guide

### Ready for Production âœ…
The multi-agent system is now ready for use! 

## Next Steps

1. **Immediate**: Test the system by having Backend Engineer complete the P1 canary task
2. **Short-term**: Refine agent configurations based on real usage
3. **Long-term**: Add more specialized agents as needed (DevOps, Mobile, etc.)
